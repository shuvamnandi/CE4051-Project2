  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

WARNING:Par:468 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.

   Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
   Route Static Timing Report"). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to ensure the best options
   are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

   Visit the Xilinx technical support web at http://support.xilinx.com and go to
   either "Troubleshoot->Tech Tips->Timing & Constraints" or "
   TechXclusives->Timing Closure" for tips and suggestions for meeting timing
   in your design.

Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 1

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
